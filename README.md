==================

Materials for the "Unstructure" workshop during SxSWi 2014. For more context:

- [Unstructure: SxSWi 2014 - Presentation](http://tiny.cc/unstructure-sxsw14-slides)

### Hierarchy

 - The `hierarchy/` directory contains copy of the JSON file we'll be using (in case we can't get it from a live API)

### Relation

 - This repo is based on a sample "Hello World" repo from Heroku, the original of which can be found [here](https://github.com/heroku/ruby-rails-sample). It is slightly changed, to load data from a simple database view into a table.

### Mutation

 - TBD
